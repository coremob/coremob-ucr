[Coremob Use Cases and Requirements](http://coremob.github.com/coremob-ucr/index.html) is published by the [W3C Core Mobile Web Platform Community Group](http://coremob.org) (Coremob, for short) as an CG Draft. Development happens on GitHub.

Please send comments to [public-coremob@w3.org](mailto:public-coremob@w3.org?subject=[coremob-ucr]) ([subscribe](mailto:public-coremob-request@w3.org), [archives](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-coremob/)). All feedback welcomed.

Editing this document
---------------------

This document is developed using a modified version of [ReSpec][respec] which handles [Markdown syntax][md]. The only thing you need to get start is a browser and a text editor. Make your changes to the `index.html` file and drag it into a browser, ReSpec will compile it into a properly formatted doc on the fly.

### Using GitHub

Please do not commit directly to the main repository _even if you have commit rights_.

Instead, please fork the repository to your own GitHub account and commit your changes there. It's best to create a new branch per feature. Please send well scoped [pull requests][pr] to the main repository.

Please note that the main branch is `gh-pages`, as this allows automatically publishing the document on GitHub pages as described in [Using GitHub for Spec Work][specs-on-github].
