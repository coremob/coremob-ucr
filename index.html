      This document describes basic use cases and requirements for mobile Web application development.
    </section>
    
    Introduction
    ------------
    
    <p class=issue>It has not been decided yet whether the best way to describe our use cases is to detail the kind of application we wish could be written on the mobile Web platform today, or whether writing scenarios is a better solution.</p>
    
    Example applications
    --------------------
    
    ### A Camera app
    
    xxx

    ### A Newspaper app
    
    xxx

    ### A Magazine app
    
    xxx

    ### An Isometric game
    
    xxx

    ### A 2D Game
    
    Fantastic Rafaela is a platform game, the goal of which is to save an imprisoned prince. This is done by navigating a character, Rafaela, across various levels from left to right. Each levels consist of a series of obstacles and enemies that the player has to avoid (by jumping over, shooting, etc). The game is played in landscape mode.

    ### A turn-by-turn navigation app
    
    xxx
    
    Scenarios
    ---------
    
    ### Update a profile picture
    
    John wants to update the profile picture of the instant messaging service he is using. The service offers the option to take a picture using the device's camera and to reformat it to the right dimensions. John does so and immediately uploads the result to use as his new profile picture.
    
    ### Take pictures in a remote area without network coverage

    Jenna is hiking in a remote area without network coverage. She takes high quality pictures using a web application. She decides to apply post-process some of the pictures she took by applying ready-made filters. The pictures are stored locally. When she returns to an area with better network coverage, her pictures are updated to a remote server. While the upload is going on in the background she can continue taking pictures or can browse her previous shots to select the ones she wants to share with her friends.
    
    Derived requirements: <a href="#camera-access" class="reqRef"></a>, <a href="#pic-manipulation" class="reqRef"></a>, <a href="#pic-manipulation" class="reqRef"></a>, <a href="#pic-upload" class="reqRef"></a>.

    Requirements
    ------------

    The following requirements are derived from the above use cases and scenarios.
    
    <p id="camera-access" class=req>It MUST be possible to take pictures using the device's camera. This MUST be done in such a way that the user's security and privacy is respected.</p>
    
    <p id="pic-manipulation" class=req>It MUST be possible to programmatically manipulate a picture so as to crop it, apply filters to it, etc. and save the result of these manipulations.</p>
    
    <p id="pic-storage" class=req>It MUST be possible to store pictures locally and retrieve them without requiring further permission from the user.</p>
    
    <p id="pic-upload" class=req>It MUST be possible to asynchronously upload pictures to remote server on different origins. Ideally, uploads should continue even if the user navigates to a different page.</p>
    
    <p id="orientation-lock" class=req>A web application might be designed to be used strictly in portrait or landscape mode. It MUST be possible to signal this preference to the User Agent.</p>
    
    <p id="fullscreen" class=req>It MUST be possible for an application to signal to the User Agent that it wants to operate fullscreen and not inside of the browser's chrome.</p>
    
    <p id="geolocation" class=req>It MUST be possible to obtain the device's current geographic coordinates provided the user consents to sharing those.</p>
    
    <p id="position" class=req>It MUST be possible to register to receive updates when the position of the device changes.</p>
    
    <p id="framerate" class=req>It MUST be able to run a canvas tag at 30FPS in fullscreen mode.</p>
    
    <p id="audio-playback" class=req>Multiple sound files MUST be able to play simultaneously with minimal latency.</p>
    
    <p id="data-storage" class=req>It MUST be possible to asynchronously store and retrieve large, structured persistent data sets.</p>
    
    ### Out of Scope
    
    Direct access to multimedia streams are out of the scope of this document.
    
    Programatic locking and/or unlocking of the device's orientation are out of scope.
